# Testing Essentials: Mock Objects Explained Companion Code

This code is runnable demonstration code from a talk entitled Test Essentials: Mock Objects Explained. The idea is to show how to use test doubles in various situations.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies using composer: `composer install`
3. Run `bin/phpunit`

## What it covers

This project has examples of using dummy, fake, stub, mock, and spy test doubles in unit tests written with PHPUnit. The tests are in the `tests/` directory and should be named appropriately to convey which type of test double they are showing. Since the tests share source code (as they would in a real project) some of this companion code differs slightly from code shown in the slide deck.

## TODO

* Comments
* Organization of tests
* Link to presentation materials
